# HackHers 2024 Project: Equal Pay

## Overview
This repository is for a 48 GSU hackathon: HackHers 2024.
Equal pay is a website focused on bridging the divide amongst men and women by empowering women through our platform. We would do this by giving them the best tools and resources to secure better pay, identify supportive workplaces, and review companies they have worked for.

Our proposed platform would work similar to websites like Glassdoor and people would be able to review each company based on their experience there.
Besides what Glassdoor would have, we would also have a "Equal Pay Certified" certification that the company would work with us to achieve. 
These companies certified with us would then be promoted first.

To achieve our mission, Equal Pay will cater to two audiences:
- Companies: On the company-facing side, organizations will receive actionable insights on how to improve their policies and practices to achieve and maintain Equal Pay certification.
- Consumers: The consumer-facing side is designed to provide users with tips, resources, and company reviews, empowering them to make informed career decisions.

## In this repo
Currently in this repo are a few sample pages of what we would have.
- (public/index.html)
  Basic page that would be our landing and has multiple things people can click on that when implemented fully will take them to that page and give them resources. (Companies, Negotiation Skills, Financial Literacy, etc)
- (public/companies.html)
  This would be consumer side to look up companies, see reviews, leave reviews, etc.
  Currently, when connected to our express server which pulls from a personal MongoDB database, it shows the companies in order based on certification first, then ratings second.
